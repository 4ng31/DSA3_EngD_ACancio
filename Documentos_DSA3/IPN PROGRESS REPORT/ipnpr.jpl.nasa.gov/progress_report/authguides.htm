<h1>Author Guidelines for The IPN Progress Report</h1>
<p>
<body>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Have your article refereed (<a href="refguides.htm"><!--- <a href=http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/tmo/progress_report/refguides.htm> --->Referee Guidelines</a>).
<p>
<li>Upload your article for clearance to the JPL Unlimited Release System (URS) at http://urs.jpl.nasa.gov. For the Publication Type, please select "Progress Report" rather than "Journal Article" or "JPL Publication." 
<p>
<li>
When your article has been cleared, please forward the e-mail notification you receive from Document Review to Marilyn.E.Morgan@jpl.nasa.gov.
<p>
<li>Complete an IPN Progress Report Paper Submittal and Approval Form (<a href="form2917-s.pdf"><!--- <a href=http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/tmo/progress_report/form2917s.pdf> --->Form 2917-S</a>). The primary JPL author and the article referee must both sign this form. Mail via Laboratory interoffice mail (or hand deliver) the completed form to the IPNPR Editor, Marilyn Morgan, at M/S 111-141 (location 111-122C). A scan of the completed and signed form sent via e-mail (Marilyn.E.Morgan@jpl.nasa.gov) is also acceptable.
<p>
<li>E-mail all electronic files (see "Electronic Files" below) and a PDF of the final version of your article as cleared by Document Review to the IPNPR Editor, Marilyn Morgan (Marilyn.E.Morgan@jpl.nasa.gov) <B>AND</B> to the Editor in Chief, Fabrizio Pollara (Fabrizio.Pollara@jpl.nasa.gov) Or, you may deliver or mail a CD to Marilyn Morgan, location 111-122C, M/S 111-141, or Fabrizio Pollara, location 238-420A, M/S 238-420. 
<p>
<li>Once your article has been cleared through Document Review and you have approved your edited/formatted article, it will be published in the next issue.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Electronic Files</h2>
<p>
Use any of the following formats:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Text: Word, LaTeX, TeX. Please also provide a PDF of your final version as cleared by URS.
<p>

<li>Figures:  Provide figures in separate native files as Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Illustrator, JPEG, Photoshop, PostScript (PS), PowerPoint, or TIFF files. Figures embedded in your article file must be extracted for use in the IPNPR; cross-platform issues have caused errors and delays, so do provide separate native files of your figures.
<p>


</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h2>Key Style Requirements</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Elements:  An abstract and some form of summary and conclusion are required.
<p>
<li>Frequency Bands:  Define radio frequencies and bands by numbers at first reference and by name in parentheses following; for example, "2.3 GHz (S-band)."
<p>
<li>Units of Measure:  All measurements must be in metric only, with no English units in parentheses. Exception: components specified in English units; for example, antenna mechanical components. In such cases, specify dimensions in English units, followed by metric in parentheses.
<p>
<li>Acronyms:  Define acronyms at their first occurrence; for example, "high-efficiency antenna (HEF)." Thereafter, use the acronym instead of spelling out the term.
 
<p>
<li>References: Within the text, references must appear in order as they are numbered in the reference list at the end of your article. References must be available in the open literature (in the case of information published on the Internet, on publicly available websites). Include the following information in your reference list: for articles, include the names of all authors (the IPN Progress Report does not use "et al." to indicate multiple authors), article name, journal name, volume and number, inclusive pages, and date of publication; for books, include all authors, title, city and state of publication, publisher, and date of publication. 

<p>
<li>Footnotes:  The following are not considered formal references and should appear in text as footnotes: a paper that has been submitted to a journal but not yet published, internal JPL documents (such as D-numbered documents or project-numbered documents), internal websites not accessible by the public, JPL interoffice memoranda, viewgraph presentations, and personal conversations or communications.
