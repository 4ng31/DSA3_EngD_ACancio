<h1>Referee Guidelines for The IPN Progress Report</h1>
<p>
<body>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The referee is a check, apart from line management, on quality and technical integrity.
<p>
<li>A written referee's report is not expected.
<p>
<li>Negotiate changes with the author and have the author make the agreed-to changes.
<p>
<li>The honor system is in effect; it is all right to sign the IPN Progress Report Paper Submittal and Approval Form (<a href="form2917-s.pdf">Form 2917-S</a>) as the referee without verifying that the changes have been made.
<p>
<li>Soundness of the work is the most important check.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Specific Instructions</h2>
<p>
Please check the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The work is sound and technically correct.
<p>
<li>The work has archival relevance to IPND (9x) programs, R&TD tasks, and reimbursable tasks related to IPND.
<p>
<li>There are no promises of what is going  to be done, only a report of what has been done, although a paper based on a formal plan is acceptable as a report of the contents of the plan.
<p>
<li>Credit is fairly given to other organizations for technical support, and there are no disparaging comments about vendors, suppliers, or other NASA centers, etc.
<p>
<li>There are an adequate abstract, some form of summary and conclusions, and accessible references (external ones and ones to prior IPND work).
</ul>
